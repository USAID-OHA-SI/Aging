# Aging

Continuity on treatment (CoT) is vital for viral suppression of clients on treatment. CoT estimates among C/ALHIV are lower than adults. Aging-up may distort proxy CoT estimates. There is a need to take a deep-dive into the outcomes of C/ALHIV on treatment through individual level data to quantify the proportion accounted for by aging-up. The data used here come from the Kenya National Data Warehouse (NDW). Underlying code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/USAID-OHA-SI/Aging/blob/main/aging.qmd) and other inputs/outputs can be found on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NN5thuBKt7aW6k7rQO5YSoRDKemEMYMV), including the [markdown document](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14feQ6uBn8VxQT31mQmzPYgmTJqUCthbd) and [visuals](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KIIU_q6MGQmwDLtM9C3UWAWkrOa9gn05).
